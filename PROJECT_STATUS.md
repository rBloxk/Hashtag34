## ⚠️ **Action Required - 2 Database Migrations**

The code is complete, but you need to run 2 SQL migrations in Supabase:

### **Quick Setup:**
1. Go to: [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/amgkkhncuarkkmwtfrct/sql/new)
2. Run Migration 1 (see below)
3. Run Migration 2 (see below)
4. Done! ✅

### **Migration 1: Fix Admin Product Addition**
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_urls TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[];
UPDATE products SET image_urls = ARRAY[base_image_url] WHERE base_image_url IS NOT NULL AND base_image_url != '' AND (image_urls IS NULL OR array_length(image_urls, 1) IS NULL);
UPDATE products SET image_urls = ARRAY['/images/products/placeholder.png'] WHERE image_urls IS NULL OR array_length(image_urls, 1) IS NULL;
COMMENT ON COLUMN products.image_urls IS 'Array of image URLs for the product. First image is typically the primary image.';
```

### **Migration 2: Enable Payment Tracking**
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_payment_id TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_stripe_payment_id ON orders(stripe_payment_id);
COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.stripe_payment_id IS 'Stripe payment intent ID for tracking payments';
```
