# Signup & Email Verification Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Duplicate Account Prevention**

3. This improves deliverability and reduces spam flags

## üí° Tips

- The verification link expires after a set time (default: 24 hours in Supabase)
- Users can request multiple verification emails (rate-limited by Supabase)
- Failed logins are logged by Supabase for security monitoring
- Consider adding a "Verify Email" reminder banner for logged-in but unverified users

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Verification emails not arriving
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify Supabase email settings
- Check Supabase Auth logs for errors
- Consider setting up custom SMTP

**Issue**: User can login without verification
- Ensure "Confirm email" is enabled in Supabase Auth settings
- Redeploy your application after enabling

**Issue**: Redirect not working after verification

- Verify `emailRedirectTo` matches allowed URLs

**Issue**: Profile not created after verification
