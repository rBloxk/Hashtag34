# Stripe Checkout Fix - Payment Gateway Integration

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing API Endpoint**
**Problem**: The checkout page was calling `/api/create-checkout-session` but this endpoint didn't exist, causing the payment gateway redirect to fail.

**Solution**: Created the missing API endpoint at `/app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`

### 2. **Form Validation Error**
**Problem**: "The string did not match the expected pattern" error was appearing due to HTML5 validation on phone and pincode fields.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper `pattern` attribute to phone field: `[0-9+\-\s()]+`
- Added proper `pattern` attribute to pincode field: `[0-9]{4,10}`
- Added helpful `title` attributes for validation messages
- Added placeholder text for better UX

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
1. **`app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`** - Stripe checkout session API endpoint

### Modified Files:
1. **`app/checkout/page.tsx`** - Fixed phone and pincode validation

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

You MUST set these environment variables in Vercel for the payment gateway to work:

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project **Hashtag34**
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (or pk_live_...)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (or sk_live_...)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (for webhook verification)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://hashtag34.vercel.app
```

### How to Get Stripe Keys:

1. **Get Publishable and Secret Keys:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
   - Click on **Developers** → **API keys**
   - Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
   - Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

2. **Get Webhook Secret:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers** → **Webhooks**
   - Click **Add endpoint**
   - Set endpoint URL: `https://hashtag34.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Select events to listen to:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - Click **Add endpoint**
   - Click on the newly created webhook
   - Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

## 🔄 Payment Flow

### Current Flow:
1. User fills out checkout form with address
2. User clicks "Place Order"
3. Order is created in database with status "pending"
4. Order items are saved
5. Stripe checkout session is created
6. User is redirected to Stripe payment page
7. User completes payment on Stripe
8. Stripe webhook notifies your server
9. Order status updated to "paid" and "confirmed"
10. User redirected to success page

## 🧪 Testing the Payment Gateway

### Using Stripe Test Mode:

1. Make sure you're using **test keys** (pk_test_ and sk_test_)
2. Go to checkout page: https://hashtag34.vercel.app/checkout
3. Fill out the form (use real-looking data)
4. Click "Place Order"
5. You should be redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Important:
1. **NEVER** commit your Stripe secret keys to Git
2. Always use **test keys** for development
3. Use **live keys** only in production

## 💰 Pricing Configuration

The checkout session automatically handles:
- ✅ Product pricing

## 🌐 Success and Cancel URLs

### Success URL:
- User redirected to: `/payment/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`

### Cancel URL:
- User redirected to: `/payment/cancel`
- User can return to cart and try again

## 📧 Customer Experience

1. **Email**: Customer receives receipt from Stripe after successful payment
2. **Phone**: Stripe collects phone number during checkout
